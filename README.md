# Weather DashBoard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard. How this works is you go to the website and enter in the search bar for the city you are looking for and it will display the weather their currently(today) and will also showcase a 5 day weather forecast for the remainder of the week. This is a great and simple app perfect for planning a vacation or if you are just looking see what the weather is going to be coming up. Thank you for checking it out! More styling to the webpage will come in the future!
